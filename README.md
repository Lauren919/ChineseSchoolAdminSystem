# Chinese School Admin System

## Project Goals
This project is an admin system for Coventry Chinese School in order to store information about their students and teachers, allowing an easy and efficient way of add, editing and deleting information.
The application should be a three-tiered system, meaning there should be a GUI layer, Model layer and a Business layer to connect the 2. There should also be tests to test all method functionality. 
The project should follow the Agile methodology, using scrum events to appropriately plan for each sprint.

I aim to have a complete database and start on building a three-tiered application with some interaction between the GUI layer and the database using the business layer.

#### Sprint Goals
- [x] User Story 0.1
- [x] User Story 0.2
- [x] User Story 0.3
- [x] Sprint review
- [x] Sprint retrospective
- [x] Update ReadMe file
- [x] commit all changes to github

#### Sprint Review
The database was created with data inserted into each table. The business layer, unit tests and GUI layer were also added to the solution.

#### Sprint Retrospective
All the user stories for the sprint was completed. However, there were some issues with commiting to git that caused some issues but these were resolved. For the next sprint, the pacing should continue and there should be less issues with git now that I feel more confident with using git.
