# Chinese School Admin System

## Project Goals
This project is an admin system for Coventry Chinese School in order to store information about their students and teachers, allowing an easy and efficient way of add, editing and deleting information.
The application should be a three-tiered system, meaning there should be a GUI layer, Model layer and a Business layer to connect the 2. There should also be tests to test all method functionality. 
The project should follow the Agile methodology, using scrum events to appropriately plan for each sprint.
